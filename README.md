contributor-stats
=================

A project to generate full contributor stats across all SuperuserLabs repositories.

It shares commit history with a [similar repo for the ActivityWatch project](https://github.com/ActivityWatch/contributor-stats) (which we should probably merge in every now and again).

The output from this tool is planned to be served from the website in the future.
